# chess

This is a self-built project, which simulates the game of chess.
It will let you know when there is checkmate, and also doesn't allow for illegal moves.

Currently working on:
  Cleaning up code, especially for checkmate and stalemate
  Adding graphics
  Adding the functionality to save a game as a line of text, and being able to put that text into the game to resume
